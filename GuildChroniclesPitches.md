## A Song of Wishes and Curses
Everyone knows the Summer court is the most important fae court, all swear fealty to them. I mean everyone knows the Winter Court is the most powerful fae courty, all swear fealty to them. Sorry, I meant everyone knows the Spring court is the most vivacous court, all swear fealty to them.
You are fae, not powerful enough to be nobility, but important enough that the exact question of where your loyalties lie is one that an uncomfortable number of people seem to be insistent that you answer. Now that Syzzygy approaches, and the Millenial tree will bloom once more, the three major courts are trying to make sure they are the strongest. Will you join one of the courts in their goal of controlling the Millenial Tree? Or try to find your own way. Where did summer go? And why have rumors of the wild hunt started to crop up again. The Blood moon isn't for another few years, right?
Goals:
- Give limited but complete freedom: While the playspace would be constrained to a map 48 miles on a side, the people, places, and adventures would entirely on the party to decide on
- Allow Spontanious Story Construction: Through the use of motivated factions, random encounter tables, and keyed hexes, no one, not even me knows where the story will go, we'll have to play and find out.
- Ignore those pesky humans: You can be human, I guess, but this is a fully fae story.
