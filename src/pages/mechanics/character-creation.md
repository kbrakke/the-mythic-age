# Creating a Character

## Generating ability scores. 
When making your character, you can pick any number between 5 and 17, after racial ability score bonuses, no stat can be above 18. Yes, I mean any number. You could pick all 17s and human to have 18 in every stat.
### Additional boons. 
If your ability scores, before racial bonuses, result in a point buy of 30 or under you may select a [Supernatural Gift](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/moot/character-creation#SupernaturalGifts) from the Theros book. If you do not take a gift, you may instead gain one of the following feats without gaining the ability score increase (Effectively you are gaining half of the feat) [Athlete](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/athlete), [Chef](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/chef), [Fey Touched](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/fey-touched), [Keen Mind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/keen-mind), [Linguist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/linguist), [Resilient](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/resilient), [Shadow Touched](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/shadow-touched), [Skill Expert](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/skill-expert), [Telepathic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/telepathic), [Weapon Master](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/weapon-master). If you choose neither let me know, the gods look favorably at those who are humble.
### Detrimental Effects. 
The gods look unkindly on hubris, on those humans who think they are close to the gods. If your point buy score is 33 or higher,  you can expect luck won't quite break your way when things are looking close. Mechanically nothing will change, I will in no way alter dice rolls to enforce this divine wrath. For some, this may even be a benefit, attaining the ire of the gods can be a fun story experience, but I assure you the gods will notice.
