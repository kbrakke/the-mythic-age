## Teeth Tree

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

***Devouring Maw.*** As an action, you can attempt to have your sword consume a creature. Make an attack roll against a creature within reach, on a success, rather than dealing damage, your sword begins to consume the creature. The creature suffers an injury and becomes restrained by your sword. On subsequent turns the only action you can take is to continue to attempt to devour the creature. Repeat this action, on a success a restrained creature becomes engulfed, an enguled creature swallowed, and a swallowed creature becomes devoured. While being devoured a creature may attempt to escape by making an acrobatics or athletics check against your sword's Save DC. Each time it attempts a this check roll 1d4 for each wound it is suffering it, it suffers damage equal to the result and takes a penalty to their roll equal to the number of dice you rolled. If the creature succeeds it moves back one step away from being devoured, and a restrained creature escapes. Each time you successfully devour a creature Almuftaras finds worthy (Read: No Bag of Rats abuse) you increase your hit point maximum by your Constituion bonus, Minimum 1. Once you use this ability, if it did not initially miss, you must complete an extended rest after questing to use it again as your sword is at least partially saited.

#### Shotel & Gladus
***Apex Deep Wounds.*** When you apply wounds to a creature with no wounds, you apply two wounds.

***Apex Debilitaing Injury.*** A creature with any injuries has disadvantage on attack rolls. Additionally The speed reduction and disadvantage linger until the end of the next round after all wounds have been removed.
