### Apex Infusion - Ahnuket's Golden Path
***The Path Revealed.*** As an action you roll a number of d20s. If you are ininitiative, you roll one for each turn currently in the initiative count, if you are out of combat you roll one for each creature you can see. Once you have these dice, you will assign them to each creature or turn in combat. If you are in combat, the first time a creature rolls a d20 on its turn, it must use the number you provided for that turn instead instead. If they do not roll a d20 on their turn, they roll a number of d6's equal to the number you assigned them taking psychic damage equal to the result. If you are not in combat, the next time the creature would roll a d20, they use the result you assigned them insted. Once you have used the ability you must complete an extended rest after questing to use it again.

### Apex Infusion - Senmanat's Offer
***Choice Yet Unmade***
As an action, you send a number of creatures, up to your proficiency bonus, that you can see in to a state of quantum superposition. Until the end of your next turn, any time that creature makes a choice and learns the results they can make a new choice and see the new results. Each creature may only have two time streams open at a time, but any timestream can split at any choice until one is decided on.
For example: A fighter may decide to advance 10 feet and attack an enemy, then move ten feet away to attack another enemy being hit by an opportunity attack, finishing their tun by critically hitting the second enemy finishing it off and using their bonus action to second-wind. They may then back up to any point in that chain and make a new choice, they could act out an entire second alternate turn starting from their movement, they could keep their movement to that first enemy but decide to action surge instead. They could accept their first attack and make a new choice before being opportunity attacked, they could take each choice in order, attemtping two courses of action each time before resolving the timestream after each choice. However, once a choice is decided on, it cannot be undone.
Once you have used the ability you must complete an extended rest after questing to use it again.
