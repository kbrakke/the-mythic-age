# Karkhadan Weapons
The Karkhadan is a mythic and majestic beast. A single horn juts from its forehead, and it's leathery skin

## Life Tree
I am the cycle of things. I am the passage of time. I am grrowth. I am entropy. All things bloom. No things escape my touch. I am Existance.

You gain the cure wounds spell if you do not already have it. You may pick Wisdom, Charisma or Intelligence to be your casting stat when you attune to this weapon. You may cast this spell a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus without expending a spell slot. Additionally you cast the spell at level 2 when you read 5th level and level 3 when you reach 10th level.

***Oasis.***

### Major Infusion

### Apex Infusion
***Pluck from the Underworld.*** As an action, you cause a dead creature, who you have at least some remains of, to spring to life where the remains are. The creature is in its prime, and returns with full hit points. Creatures that witness this event gain 3d10+ your proficiency bonus temporary hit points. A creature with these temporary hitpoints has advantage on saving throws


## Death Tree
I am the end of things. I am the passage of time. I am decay. I am entropy. All things wither. No things escape my touch. I am Finality.

You gain the Eldritch Blast Cantrip and the agonizing blast invocation if you do not already have them. If you already have either do, you may pick a different warlock cantrip or invocation instead.
