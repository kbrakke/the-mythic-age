Dryad Weapons have the following properties
You learn the Summon Beast spell if you do not already know it and may cast it without using a spell slot a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus. You may increase the spell level by using multiple of these castings, increasing the level by 1 for each additional casting used.
When an ability states *Summoned Creatures* these are creatures summoned using a spell, such as *Find Familiar*, *Create Undead*, or *Summon Woodland Spirits* or a class feature such as *Animal Companion*
## Shepard Tree
Your inclination is to help and nourish. Summoned creatures gain additional hit points equal to your level.
### Basic Infusion
#### Orb
***Stronger Together.*** When a creature you summoned is adjacent to an ally, they both gain +1 AC.
#### Amulet
***Ward.*** As a reaction, when a creature you have summoned is struck with an attack, you can give the creature resistance to that damage.
### Major Infusion
You gain a +1 to attack, damage and healing rolls for spells you cast with this as your focus.
#### Orb
***Major Stronger Together.*** In addition if an ally (including creatures you summon) moves while adjacent to a creature you have summoned, it does not provoke opportunity attacks. 
#### Amulet
***Major Ward.*** When you use your ward, you may use the targeted creature's reaction instead of your own.
### Apex Infusion - Hamaledies Respite
You gain a +2 to attack, damage, and healing rolls for spells you cast with this staff as your focus. 
***Hamaledies Respite.*** As an action you lift your staff up on high and a wave of calming energy floods over you. Any number of creatures within 60 feet of you gain the effects of a short rest. This includes spending hit dice to heal. Once you use this ability you must take an extended rest after adventuring before it can be used again.
#### Orb
***Apex Stronger Together.*** Allies now gain +1 AC for each allied creature adjacent to them. 
#### Amulet
***Apex Ward.*** If you use ***your*** reaction, you instead prevent all damage that would be dealt to your summoned creature.
## Fury Tree
You turn the forces of nature against those who would seek to destroy it, whenever your summoned creatures deal damage, increase that damage by half of your proficiency bonus rounded down.
### Basic Infusion
#### Orb
***Pack Tactics.*** If one of your summoned creatures is "Flanking" with an ally, they gain advantage on the attack roll.
#### Amulet
***Revenge.*** If one of your summoned creatures is damage, you can use its reaction to deal half that damage to the creature who damaged it.

### Major Infusion
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, and a +2 bonus to damage rolls on spells and attacks when using this weapon.
#### Orb
***Major Pack Tactics.*** If one of your summoned creatures is "Flanking" with an ally, both creatures gain advantage on their attack rolls.
#### Amulet
***Major Revenge.*** If one of your summoned creatures is damage, it can use its reaction to deal half that damage to the creature who damaged it.
### Apex Infusion - Melinoe's Revenge
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls, and a +4 bonus to damage rolls on spells and attacks when using this weapon.

***Melinoe's Revenge.*** The natural order of things is disturbed. You will set them right. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you must make a dexterity saving throw. A creature has disadvantage on this saving throw if it has damaged your or one of your allies and you are aware of it. Creatures that fail take 4d6 piercing damage and are restrained as thick thorns grow from the ground to grapple them. Creatures that succeed take half the damage and may move 5 feet to any adjacent space.
These vines are your revenge and will equalize the wrongs that have been wrought against you. A vine has an AC of 14, hit points equal to 4 times your level, vulnerability to slashing and fire damage, and a reach of 10 feet. Each vine may only restrain one large or smaller creature. Vines last forever. Once on each of your turns, including the turn you use this ability, you can perform one of the following actions.
- ***Lash.*** A vine attacks a creature of your choice within its reach, it gains a bonus to its attack roll equal to twice your proficiency bonus. If it hits, the creature takes 2d6+your proficiency bonus piercing damage and is restrained by the vine. 
- ***Absorb.*** A vine constricts a creature. It does 3d6 necrotic damage, and a creature of your choice within 30 feet of the vine gains a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt.
- ***Alert.*** All vines become alert and wait for movement. The next time a creature moves in reach of a vine, that vine uses lash.
You always know the status of your vines, and if it has caught anything.

Once you use this ability you must complete an extended rest after adventuring before using it again.

#### Orb
***Apex Pack Tactics.*** You and your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against creatures with 2 or more of your allies adjacent to them.
#### Amulet
***Apex Revenge.*** If you used your reaction, you may also deal the same amount of damage to any creature you can see that has ever damaged you.
