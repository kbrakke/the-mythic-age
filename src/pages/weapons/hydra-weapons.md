# Hydra Weapons

## Base Features
Weapons made from Hydras are sinewy writhing things, several tendrils hover around constantly in motion.
Hydra weapons have the following properties

* ***Lashing Heads.*** Whenever you make an attack with this weapon, you may target up to one additional creature within sixty feet of you as a shadowy hydra's head lashes out from your weapon. You do not suffer disadvantage from being a ranged attack on this additional attack if the target is within five feet of you.
* ***Regeneration.*** Whenever you regain hit points by spending hit dice, you may roll one additional hit die and regain that many hit points without spending a hit die.
* If an ability from this weapon requires a saving throw the DC is 8 + twice your proficiency bonus.

As an action, choose a creature and make an attack roll for each attack you can make with a single action along with each snapping head attack you may make. The attack misses only if every roll misses. Each critical hit adds an additional weapon damage die to the final damage roll. The total damage for this attack is one weapon damage die for each hit, your ability modifier once for each hit, a weapon damage die for each critical hit, bonus damage for your weapon attack for each hit and any bonus damage for a critical hit for each critical hit.

An Apex Hydra weapon improves upon its abilities based on its weapon type

#### Shortbow & Doru
***Apex Lurking Bite.*** Creatures struck by your lurking bite attack must make a wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for one minute. They gain advantage on the saving throw if they can see you. A creature frightened this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns ending the effect on a success. While frightened this way they have disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks even if they cannot see you.

#### Longbow & Javelin
***Apex Greater Reach.***  Your additional head attacks have a range of 600 feet, and any grappling heads gain additional hitpoints equal to your level. Finally, when a creature grappled by one of your heads begins its turns, roll your weapon damage, that creature takes damage equal to your result.

#### Longbow & Javelin

***Tether.*** When you hit a creature with your additional attack, you can tether to it. If you do, whenever you take damage, the tethered creature takes the same amount of damage.

#### Shorbow & Doru
***Apex Vitality Drain.*** Whenever you would gain temporary hitpoints, you may choose to instead gain hit dice. You may do this a number of times equal to your constitution modifier. Once you have done so you need to take a long rest before regaining more hit dice.

#### Longbow & Javelin
***Apex Tether*** While tethered, you may spend an action to drain the life from the creature you are attached to. The target must make a constituion saving throw, taking 8d6 damage on a failed save, half on success. You gain temporary hitpoints equal to the damage dealt. If this kills the creture you regain one hit die and may immedeately transfer the tether to a creature within range of you that fails at a constitution saving throw.
