# The Company of the Golden Lion

The Company of the Golden Lion is an adventuring guild. As monsters have become more pressing, and international affairs have grown more tense, the order has presented itself as a neutral party, one that can handle a variety of issues and owes no specific allegiance. This has been tested many times, and there are many who accuse the group of directly assisting Ereshkigal with constructing Godsend on Ganzir. They have not publicly confirmed if their adventures lead to it’s construction, but the parts and magic came from somewhere outside of Sarmania. Many of their missions come from international merchants looking for assistance, there are some wealthy Treasure Hunters, as well as the occasional charity case. In the rarest of situations, a nation will ask for the Golden Lion to assist in their affairs. The only contracts they refuse are those that would pit them against other members of the Golden Lion. This adamant neutrality has won them admirers and foes alike.

As relatively recent members to the Company, you are not yet privy to the inner workings, but for now the Golden Lion presents a way to gain money, fame, and eventually influence. From there the choice is yours.

Some time has passed, the relatively dire situation the Company finds itself in is evident. However, Alexandar Doxos, the founder has a few words in these trying times.

> The Company of the Golden Lion is dying. Perhaps that is the fate it deserves, being named for our first kill.” he pauses. “Most of you do not know why we are the Golden Lion. Our first job, when Sarmania and Na-Keb were at each others throats. Before the Deicide. The Khebites were desperate and Hisperia heard through her network that they were discreetly looking for outside help. Contractors was their term.
> They had a contract for Waste Management. ” He scans the crowd, “The waste in this particular situation was Sherali, the Golden Lion. She was the general of the southern Satrape. Shamash, the sun god was her second triumvir, their third, a magistrate, was unimportant. They were unbeatable. All along the border, settlement after settlement fell, consumed by the Sarmanian War machine. I was young, fresh off the first Lycian – Apolitain war with a group of contract soldiers loyal to me. We took the job.”
> He sighs, “It was a tough year, we lost good fighters, but we gained many more. And we had something else, a bond of iron, tempered in the forge of this campaign. Finally we brought her down, in some no name hamlet on the edge of the world, all our time spent fighting, losing, learning, planning and growing culminated in this one victory. We were paid, eventually, the gears of the Na-Keb bureaucracy turn slowly, but more importantly we had fame.”
> He smiles, for the first time in this speech. “We were wanted. The Legends are true! We are the company that slew Almuftaras for the Carba patriarch, we are the company that held Polita farmlands from the Lycian crusades. We are the company that recovered a Pearl of Atlantis.” he pauses, his face falls as the present catches up to him. He looks at you all and makes a gesture, in a circle, encompassing you all. “We are that company.”
> “But times have changed. No longer are the powerful banging down our door to hire us, other powers have grown up in that time. No longer are we the envy of the world over, for they too have been able to do great things. No, we are not the same company of old, but we are the next company. One that will accomplish just as great deeds, ones that the annals will record for all time.” “We will grow, and so too will our star, until once again the leaders of gods and mortals are asking us to intervene on their behalf.”
> “You will bring this company in to its new golden age. You all, who have come from all over the world, you all who have brought your experience, you all will forge a bond of comradery, we all will be a new family. “To do this task we must grow, and we must show our new and growing list of enemies that we are not the last dying gasp of a lion too old to hunt, but rather a new lioness, ready to kill and provide for the pride.”
> He gestures to a group. Two humans and a Khenra, “The Fraternius Liberatus has all but declared war on us. They openly attack our caravans, and continued, for days to harass our members. Those who attack one of us, attack us all.”
> “The Sarmanians continue their Mind Games, first attacking us repeatedly, but then seeming to offer a truce. Deception in the name of military advantage has long been their modus operandi, and they are playing us for fools.” Right now, the Sarmanians, and the Fraternitus Liberatus seek to end the company, but they have picked the wrong fight. And we will expand. The people on the borders need us, and in saving them they will join us. We will grow as we show the people of this world that The Company of the Golden Lion

### Follow Up: Pro-Bono 👹
A potential series of monster attacks on the western villages is of concern. And while traveling south they would be met at Phonos, if they happened to go northeast, the devastation to the farmlands of Theria would be immense. If you can spare the time to investigate the status of the western swamps, we would appreciate intel on the scale of this potential monster threat. Given the legends of the Hydra of the Southern Swamp, I have a bad feeling about this...

### Defeat the Cult at Atlantis 🔥
We have a location and a dream. You could try to make your way out there blind in a rowboat I guess, but perhaps you should prepare. What do you mean invisible walls? I just said you could try... Oh, do you think that there are literally invisible walls protecting this base? Perhaps we should do some more research. Did you just say "Choo Choo?" I don't understand... 

### No Bone Unturned 𓂀 💰
Well it looks like our spate of handling international cults has caught on and a few other nations are interested in our services again. Heknuhedjet, the court physican, holder of the pearl of life, keeper of the white wand etc. Has asked use to accompany a small force trying to recover any of Min's remains. It's been about a decade since they have been to the area, so no one is sure what could have changed since then. I'm guessing their worried if their hiring mercenaries on top of it. Or perhaps she's worried it's something the Board won't want the citizien to find... 

### The Lumber Must Flow 💰
A route leading from Politia to the Polemtoros has been very spotty lately. Supplies going to and from are growing sparser by the week and any of the crews that make it through report seeing older carts by the side of road abandoned. Some are able to be recovered, but just as often people who go to fetch them never return. At this point people aren't willing to take this route at any price and many of the lumberjacks have left, heading to other towns in Theus to try their luck. A group of mill owners have collected the funds to have us look in to the matter. Hopefully the problem is something more... corporeal.
