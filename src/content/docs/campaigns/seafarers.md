## Events

### Delved in to the Depths of Atlantis

The party having their fortunes told by the Oracle at Techni were roped in to a grand adventure for the lost civilization of Atlantis. Achilles Doxos, sandal merchant, put together a group to venture forth to test the navigational techniques of his companion Rationality. Adding another scholar to the party, Discovery, the group set forth. They found several mutant fish-people attempting to sink their ship. After fighting these groups off the party discovered a vast set of ruins under the sea.

They found some sea caves allowing them to venture further down and discovered more of these monsters. Fighting their way through they found a relic of ancient arcane technology, a Driftglobe granting near constant light.

They then found an ancient shrine, Enterop, feeling compelled, touched the shrine and was given a vision of the depths, of Tartarus, of the legendary Primordials. There he `agreed / was conscripted` into the `service / worship` of the titans. With `kymsara / pact` sealing the deal.
### Confront the Water Cult
Recovering from their delve, they party took another day to explore, eventually finding a group of people hiding in the ruins of Atlantis. They fell in to worship of Charybdis, the Wave That Will Overwhelm the World. Their leader Gar Shatterkeel was consumed and transformed by Charybdis in to the half-crab creature he is now. Durring a tense dinner Enterop revealed his experience in Tartarus allowing them to escape with the task to continue cult recruitment. The party has not done a great job of that so far.
### Rescued Parti from Sarmanian Sabatoge
While waiting for Achille to assemble a second expedition the group went to find some merchanting contracts. They had heard of Lathus Magnus, one of the few remaining shipping magnates in Lycia. They talked to one of his associate branches and were contracted to deliver a shipment of weapons to the front in the war with Sarmania. Hearing of their adventures, the associate offered significantly higher pay to help with some smuggling. The smuggling in question was brining a person deep in to sarmanian territory as well as rescuing a defector from Sarmania. Quite a bit more risk. 

Along the way they helped a weaponcrafter with some herding and got high tech weapons for the front. 

In Parti they found the water supplies cut off. Searching for the source of the potential block they found a group of Sarmanians attempting to install a large liver inside a box to poison the water supply. The party dispatched the Sarmanians far easier than the lion that attacked them just hours before, and brought the liver back for study.
### Rescued *The Ship* from Dagon's Ghost Ship
Finally deep in to Sarmanian territory the party took their last night's sleep on the boat before landfall. Unfortunately they were awoken deep into the night by a massive spectral ship attempting to consume their vessel.

After several hours of tense fighting, several wasting diseases and clever planning, the party found their ship freed of this Irkallan influence and made landfall with the blessing of the sea.
## Current Location

Having finally landed deep in Sarmanian territory, the party can regroup and determine their best plan forward. Gina is somewhere in the beauracratic system of Kar Nergral. Riat has few contacts remaining, but can tell you where there might be gaps in the surveillance of the Paqudu.
