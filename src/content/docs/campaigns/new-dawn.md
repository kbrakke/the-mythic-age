# New Dawn Associates

A group brought together by a chance meeting at the Oracle at Techni, this group has found themselves embroiled in a nations spanning conspiracy, the full extent of which has yet to be revealed. From their humble start as traders, messengers (or spies), and washed up detectives, they learned secrets of the Fraternus Liberatus, made allies of the true movers in Lycia, gained the favor of an eccentric Sarmanian ex-pat, and gained favor with a secret organization working behind the scenes to unite all others against Sarmania.

Recently, they uncovered part of the nature of Na-Keb, the nation in its entirety is built to bring the human spirit in to a knowable, controlable stasis. This pleases the Board (The pantheon of Khebite Gods). With that knowledge, and another mission successfully complete for The Order of the New Dawn, the group seeks to return to Maruk and establish their next moves.

## Dramatis Personae
### Benny
Where Benny's loyalties lie is anyone's guess, but a lifetime of traveling the woods under times of war, peace, monster presence, and any combination of the above have given him valuable skills. Whoever can give those skills the best return is an ally to Benny. And right now The Order of the New Dawn seems to have the deepest pockets.
### Gir
A former detective, this Ardhadeva spends most of his time drinking and goofing. Don't let his unserious exterior fool you though, his fists are deadly up to any level of BAC
### Murrigan
Another Ardhadeva, this time a lost trader. His devotion to Kali, as well as his time in Na-Keb has shown him many of the strange happenings. Now that he is free, he will need to decide what else this world has for him so far from home.
