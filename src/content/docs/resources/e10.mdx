import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The world of the mythic age is an Epic 10 style game. This means once a character reaches 10th level they no longer gain any levels.
However they continue to gain experience. This experience is used to gain feats and ability score increases.

Every 8,000 xp a character gains 1 abilty score increase. This may be used the same as a normal ability score increase. In addition the character gains hitpoints equal to 1+Constitution Modifier.
However, if a character foregoes this ability score increase, once they have gained 2 ability score increases they may gain a feat instead, selecting from the list below as well.

Some feats increase an ability score by 1. These feats may be taken without that increase for only 8,000 xp.

A character gains hit points every 8,000 xp, regardless of whether they gain an ability score increase or a feat.

### Martial Mastery

- *Barbarian* - You increase your critical hit range by 2.
- *Ranger* - When making a skill check, attack roll or saving throw, if you are using strength or dexterity, and the ability you are using is lower than the other, you may add your proficiency bonus to that roll (*Note:* no roll can have your proficiency bonus added to it more than twice). If both your strength and dexterity scores are the same, you instead add half your proficiency bonus to all of these rolls. In addition you add one quarter of your proficiency bonus to Strength and Dexterity damage rolls.
- *Monk* - Increase the die size of your unarmed strikes by one, increase your maximum ki points by your proficiency bonus.

When a Paragon Monster would use a legendary resistance to succeed on a saving throw, you may instead have them re-roll the saving throw with disadvantage. This still uses that legendary resistance.

### Weapon Master

You gain the following mastery.
*Weapon Master* - You gain +1 to all melee and ranged weapon attack rolls (This includes unarmed strikes). 

In addition choose one of the following masteries to gain. You may take this feat multiple times, when you do, you only gain a new additional mastery.

- *Heavy Weapon Master* - The dice of heavy weapons you roll increase. 2d6 -> 2d8; 1d12 -> 1d16; 1d10 -> 1d14. If your doing some spicy chimera weapon shit ask me what dice you can now roll. 
- *Defense Master* - Your AC increases by an additional 1 while wearing armor. (I never give out +x armor, so you know how much I think this is worth)
- *Dueling Master* - If you're doing the dueling thing with a shield, you can now use that as part of two weapon fighting. If you're doing it without a shield gain +1 to your AC and +2 to your damage rolls
- *Unarmed Master* - Increase your unarmed die by 1 (1d12 -> 1d14 -> 1d16 -> 1d20 -> 1d24 -> 1d30) You can now restrain creatures you have grappled. If you are grappling one creature, you may make an additional grapple check against that creature. If you succeed they are now restrained. You may only have one creature restrained at a time. And if you are restraining a creature you cannot grapple other creatures. *Note -* normally you can only grapple things one size larger than you.

  * If you reduce their movement, either double the reduction, or make it last an additional round.
  * If you would cause them to be knocked prone, they must use their action to make an acrobatics check to stand or you cause them to have disadvantage on the initial check to stay standing
  * If you would push or pull a creature, either double the distance or give them disadvantage on a saving throw to resist the movement
