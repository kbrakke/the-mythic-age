## Base Features
Weapons made from Serpopards are sleek and sinuous, with an uncanny ability to move in ways that seem to defy their form.

It can fit through spaces as small as 1 inch, and if harmed instantly retracts with a yowl. It can exert up to 100 pounds of force and manipulate fine objects.
* You gain resistance to poison damage
