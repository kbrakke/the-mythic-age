# Leucrotta Weapons
The Leucrotta is the bogeyman of legends, luring travelers off their path using all forms of mimicry to trick them in to dangerous situations. Many a caravan has been lost, only to be found weeks later, everyone dead as a plague ran through them.  
## Disease Tree
Whenever you hit a creature with this weapon it gains a disease die. A disease die is a d6, a creature can have any number of disease dice. When a creature with your disease dice ends its turn, it must succeed on a constitution saving throw or the disease worsten ones step. Creatures with any of your disease dice are considered to be at step 0 on the Disease track. 

If a creature succeeds on this saving throw, they move one step down towards 0. If a creature on step 0 succeeds on two saving throws in a row, all disease dice are removed from that creature. If a creature is on the disease track, but does not have any disease dice it still makes saving throws as normal.

When a creature succeeds on this saivng throw, as a reaction, you can spend a disease die, roll it, and subtract that number from the saving throw, potentially causing the creature to fail.
