# Weapons
Weapons in the mythic age a built on top of one another. A simple axe can grow in to a fearsome "Scorching Winds" Labrys as you slay and harvest monster parts. Weapon progression is split in to five tiers, the first two are mundane weapons and represent weapon specialization. A longsword can be reforged in to the powerful Shotel, or the more precise Spatha. From there you can modify you weapon, customizing it to match your fighting style. The final three are magical weapons infused with the power and abilities of the monsters they are made of. Your Shotel can gain the power and strength of the Manticore, progressing through "Shooting Spikes", "Peircing Spikes" and finally "Mukhwzaq's Pinning Thorns" as you slay greater and greater monsters.
