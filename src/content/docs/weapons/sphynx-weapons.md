# Sphynx Weapons
## Base Features

## Fate Tree
Mortals move in this world governed by the same laws that make rocks fall, flowers bloom or the sun set. You are no more able to change your fate than the sun is able to stay hidden. These laws govern your existance, and you are now one of the few able to see the path that lies before you all.
### Minor Infusion - Action
#### Wand
***Written In the Stars.*** You learn the ***Augury*** and ***Divination*** spells and may cast them each one per day without consuming a spell slot or material components. You never suffer any chance of a false reading for those spells. When you ask the question, the answer will be as actionable as possible.
#### Rod
***Etched In Stone.*** You learn the guidance cantrip if you do not already know it. When a creature uses guidance, after the roll, but before knowing the results, you may change your guidance die to a 4. You may do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you regain spent uses when you take a long rest. 
### Major Infusion - Reaction
You gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.
#### Wand
***Major Written In the Stars.*** When you or a creature you can see would fail a check, attack roll or saving throw related to any advice you have gained through divination spells, you can use your reaction to allow the creature to re-roll the check, attack, or saving throw. Once you use this ability you must complete a short rest before using it again.
#### Rod
***Major Etched In Stone.*** Your ***Guidance*** now lasts until it is used, only one creature may benefit from your guidance at once. 
### Apex Infusion - Ahnuket's Golden Path
You gain a +2 to spell attack rolls and a +1 to your spell save DC.
You gain the following two abilites:
* ***Arbiter of Fate*** Choose any number of creatures that you can see. For each creature roll a d20. You may then assign those dice to a number of creatures equal to double your proficiency bonus. The next time those creatures would roll a d20, they use the assigned result instead. If the number is greater than 20, for each 20 creatures you may instead assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, 18, 19, 20.

Once you have used the ability you must complete an extended rest after questing to use it again. 
* ***Walk the Golden Path.*** For each turn in initative, roll a d20. You may then assign those d20s to each turn. The first time a creature would roll a d20 on its turn, it must use the assigned number instead. If a creature does not roll a d20 on its turn, it rolls a number of d6's equal to the assigned number and takes that much psychic damage.

Once you have used the ability you must complete an extended rest after questing to use it again. 

#### Wand
***Apex Written In the Stars.*** You have made a favorable impression on the Fates. You may cast the spell ***Comune*** to talk with the Fates. If possible, they will give you true and actionable advice about your next course of action. Once the advice comes to pass, you gain Inspiration.
#### Rod
***Apex Etched In Stone.*** You may now grant ***Guidance*** to a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus. 
## Free-Will Tree
Mortals are gifted with an ability to do something most other creatures cannot do, make a choice. Your path is not one set in stone, etched in gold, cast in iron. Your path is ever flowing, ever changing. You can see the world is filled with blessed possibility, and you are now one of the few able to see beyond the veil, and witness the cosmic chaos.

***Choice Yet Unmade***
As an action, you send a number of creatures, up to your proficiency bonus, that you can see in to a state of quantum superposition. Until the end of your next turn, any time that creature makes a choice and learns the results they can make a new choice and see the new results. Each creature may only have two time streams open at a time, but any timestream can split at any choice until one is decided on.

For example: A fighter might choose to advance 10 feet to attack a creature, miss the first attack, hit the second attack, move away from the creature provoking an attack of opportunity and advance to another creature. Then use action surge to attack the new creature another two times, killing it finishing the turn with a second wind. The fighter might then decide to play out an entire alternate turn starting at the beginning before comparing the two and deciding which turn to take.

Alternately, the fighter could check after each choice. After the first attack it could restart the turn, advancing 15 feet to a different location at the same monster, and retrying the attack. After seeing that result it could pick one choice and make a second attack, repeating the split check resolve for each individual choice. You could see if an opportunity attack hits before deciding to move away from a monster, you could learn if a monster saves before deciding which spell to cast, and so on. Once a choice is made however, it cannot be undone. 

Once you have used the ability you must complete an extended rest after questing to use it again.
