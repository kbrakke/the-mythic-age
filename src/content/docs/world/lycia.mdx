Lycia stands as a bold experiment in human governance following Godsfall 25 years ago. Once the heart of the mighty Pontinate Empire with its pantheon of civic-minded gods who oversaw everything from architecture to urban planning, Lycia has transformed into a nation attempting to forge its destiny through democratic principles rather than divine guidance.

Godsfall devastated the northern territories, leaving much of the countryside scarred with ruins and crumbling infrastructure. The collapse of the Pontinate pantheon created a power vacuum that was quickly filled by revolutionary fervor inspired by philosophies of self-governance and human autonomy. What emerged was a chaotic but passionate democracy where citizens vote directly on matters from infrastructure projects to military campaigns.

The past 25 years have been tumultuous with an early war against their western brethren the Apolitain League. Fortunately for most the war was quick, more of a skirmish, a tantrum thrown by a new nation. More worryingly though were the years of rooting out Pontinate sympathies. The long and bloody process has died down in most areas as the focus has turned to the colonies and rebuilding. Occasional witch hunts spike in the larger cities, but people want to move past it.  Unfortunately the forces of Gaius Marius Maximus continue to roam the countrysides. Once a grand legion under the Pontinate Empire, it has been reduced to small bands still refusing to surrender to the new order. Unfortunately for the Lycians, their military experience and prowess continues to far outmatch the new Democratic People's Army.

Currently Lycia is at a crossroads, Lycia herself has begun to make motions towards rebuilding much of the Pontinate infrastructure. Not, as some outsiders would argue, because the old ways were better, but because the Lycian people are builders and that legacy is for the people, not from the gods. A new focus on the colonies in the Sarmanian sub-continent has also gripped the people. Now taking on the symbolic nature of the struggle against Divine Rule along with the previous practical struggle of providing food for the nation.

All this while to the north the Elves continue to warn of great monsters stirring in the woods. The northern forests are large and unknown, who knows what lurks in those vast expanses.
